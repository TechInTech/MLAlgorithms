# AdaBoost

This code implements Support Vector machine based on Sequential Minimal Optimization. The code is tested under Python 3.6.4 and Python 2.7.12 in Ubuntu 16.04. It should work in Windows and macOS if required libraries are installed.

## Algorithm

## Dataset

## Performance

Run the test script in command line.
```
python Test.py
```
Plot decision boundaries on both training set and test set.  
The algorithm works well.
