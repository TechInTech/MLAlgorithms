# AdaBoost

This code implements AdaBoost method based on Decision Tree classifier.

The code is tested under Python 3.6.4 and Python 2.7.12 in Ubuntu 16.04.

It should work in Windows and macOS if required libraries are installed.

## Algorithm

## Dataset

## Performance

Plot learning curves of error rates of training set and test set.

The algorithm works well.
